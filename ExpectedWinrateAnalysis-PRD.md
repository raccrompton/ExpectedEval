# Expected Winrate Analysis - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Replace the existing analysis pane components (Maia analysis, Stockfish analysis, moves by rating, move map, blunder meter) with a unified "Expected Winrate" analysis that combines Maia 2's human-like move predictions with Stockfish's position evaluations to predict realistic game outcomes.

### 1.2 Success Criteria
- **Functional**: Accurate winrate calculations that help users understand move consequences
- **Performance**: Visible progress during calculations (time not critical)
- **Usability**: Users can interpret results within 30 seconds
- **Technical**: Clean integration with existing chess engine infrastructure

## 2. Product Requirements

### 2.1 Core Functionality

#### 2.1.1 Analysis Algorithm
**Expected Winrate** = Weighted average win probability across likely future continuations where:
- Move probabilities come from Maia 2 (human-like behavior)
- Position evaluations come from Stockfish (optimal analysis)

#### 2.1.2 User Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Options | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|---------|----------|
| Probability Threshold | Dropdown | 10%, 1%, 0.1% | 10% | Controls analysis tree depth |
| Stockfish Depth | Dropdown | 15, 20, 25 | 15 | Analysis depth for evaluations |
| Winrate Loss Threshold | Float Input | e.g., -0.1 | -0.1 | Max acceptable winrate loss from initial position |
| Maia Rating Level | Current Selection | 1100-1900 | User's current | Human skill level for predictions |

#### 2.1.3 Calculation Process
1. **Move Filtering**: Get legal moves, evaluate with Stockfish, filter by winrate loss threshold
2. **Tree Generation**: Build Maia probability trees for each candidate move
3. **Endpoint Evaluation**: Evaluate tree leaf positions with Stockfish
4. **Player-Aware Pruning**: Stop analysis when analyzing player makes bad moves
5. **Expected Calculation**: Compute weighted average winrates

### 2.2 User Interface Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Parameter Controls Panel
- **Layout**: Horizontal row of 4 controls above results
- **Responsive**: Stack vertically on mobile
- **Validation**: Real-time input validation with error states
- **Persistence**: Remember user preferences across sessions

#### 2.2.2 Results Display - Main View
**Ranked Move List** (replacing MovesByRating component at lines 327-333 in AnalysisSidebar.tsx):
```
Move            Expected Win Rate    Confidence    Tree Depth
1. Nf3              67.3%             High          4.2 plies
2. e4               65.8%             High          3.8 plies
3. d4               63.1%             Medium        3.1 plies
```

**Column Specifications**:
- **Move**: SAN notation, clickable for detail view
- **Expected Win Rate**: Percentage (1 decimal), color-coded by quality
- **Confidence**: High (>80%), Medium (60-80%), Low (<60%) tree coverage
- **Tree Depth**: Average analyzed depth (1 decimal)

#### 2.2.3 Results Display - Detail View
**Interactive Tree Visualization** (when clicking a move):
- **UI Architecture Decision**: Implement using **Approach 2: UI Pattern Reuse**
  - **Reuse visual patterns** from MovesContainer.tsx tree navigation (lines 487-572, 574-664)
  - **Create purpose-built component hierarchy**: 
  - `ExpectedWinrateTree.tsx` (main container)
  - `ExpectedWinrateBranch.tsx` (individual branches) 
  - `ExpectedWinrateSequence.tsx` (linear sequences)
  - All using unified `ExpectedWinRateNode` data structure
  - **Leverage existing** responsive mobile/desktop layouts and interaction patterns
  - **Maintain semantic clarity** - Probability trees distinct from game progression trees

**Tree Visualization Features**:
- Expandable/collapsible tree nodes showing move sequences using existing `VariationTree` styling
- Probability flow: Visual representation of cumulative probabilities with tree connectors
- Win rate annotations: Stockfish win rates at key nodes with existing color coding patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile horizontal scroll vs desktop tree view (following MovesContainer patterns)

**Tree Node Interaction - Board Preview Mode**:
- **Click Behavior**: When user clicks a tree node, chess board updates to show position after that move sequence
- **Preview Mode Requirements**:
  - **Temporary Display**: Board shows position preview without changing main analysis context
  - **Visual Indicators**: Subtle board overlay indicating "preview mode" active
  - **Highlighted Node**: Clicked tree node remains visually highlighted during preview
  - **Return Mechanism**: "Return to Analysis" button or ESC key to exit preview mode
  - **Non-Disruptive**: Expected Winrate calculations and analysis position unchanged during preview
- **Educational Value**: Users can visualize potential future positions from probability tree paths
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys for tree traversal, Enter for preview, ESC to return
- **Summary Stats**:
  - Total branches analyzed: X
  - Coverage: Y% of likely continuations
  - Calculation time: Z ms
- **Cache Status**: Show if results are cached/fresh (as specified in feature plan)

#### 2.2.4 Progressive Display & Performance Indicators
**Two-Phase Progress Display**:
- **Phase A**: Show Maia trees immediately as they're generated (move probabilities visible)
- **Phase B**: Update trees with Stockfish evaluations as they complete (winrates appear)
- **Progressive Ranking**: Move list re-sorts as expected winrates are calculated

**Performance Indicators**:
- **Loading State**: Progress bar showing current phase and completion percentage
- **Calculation Time**: Display total computation time
- **Status Messages**: "Generating Maia trees..." â†’ "Evaluating positions with Stockfish..."
- **Visual Cues**: Trees show "Evaluating..." until Stockfish winrates are available

### 2.3 Technical Requirements

#### 2.3.1 Architecture Compliance & Integration
**Follow Existing Controller Hook + Context + Presentational Components Pattern**:
- **Controller Hook**: `useExpectedWinrateController` integrating with existing engine infrastructure

- `ExpectedWinRateResult`: Complete analysis result with confidence and timing
- `ExpectedWinrateAnalysis`: Integration type extending existing `AnalysisResult` patterns

#### 2.3.4 Engine Integration & Caching Requirements
- **Stockfish Integration**: Work within existing depth management system (useAnalysisController.ts:617)
- **Maia Integration**: Coordinate with existing `currentMaiaModel` state and model loading (lines 601-610)
- **Evaluation Coordination**: Use existing `inProgressAnalyses` Set to prevent conflicts
- **Caching Strategy**: Extend existing `generateAnalysisCacheKey` rather than creating parallel system

- **Input Validation**: Follow existing parameter validation patterns from analysis components
- **UI Error States**: Match existing error display patterns from analysis sidebar

#### 2.3.7 Tree UI Integration Strategy - Critical Requirements
**UI Reuse Decision**: Implement **Approach 2: UI Pattern Reuse** for Expected Winrate tree visualization

**Reuse from Existing Game Tree Navigation (MovesContainer.tsx)**:
- **Visual Styling**: `VariationTree` and `InlineChain` CSS patterns and tree connectors (lines 487-572, 574-664)
- **Responsive Layouts**: Mobile horizontal scroll vs desktop tree view patterns (lines 215-327 vs 329-446) 
- **Interaction Patterns**: Click handlers, hover states, current node highlighting (lines 231-235, 271-275)
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation patterns and ARIA support for tree traversal

**Purpose-Built New Architecture**:
- **ExpectedWinrateTree.tsx**: Main tree container component using existing visual patterns but optimized for probability trees
- **ExpectedWinrateBranch.tsx**: Individual tree branch component (equivalent to VariationTree from MovesContainer.tsx)
- **ExpectedWinrateSequence.tsx**: Linear sequence component (equivalent to InlineChain from MovesContainer.tsx)
- **ExpectedWinRateNode**: Unified data structure designed for both algorithm processing and UI display
- **Board Preview Logic**: Temporary position display without affecting main analysis state
- **Preview State Management**: Separate state for preview mode vs main analysis mode

**Integration Requirements**:
- **Analysis Toggle Integration**: Must work seamlessly with existing analysis enabled/disabled system (AnalysisSidebar.tsx:84-102)
- **Move Highlighting Coordination**: Integrate with existing move highlighting and arrow drawing systems  
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Preserve existing keyboard shortcuts for analysis navigation and move selection
- **Engine Status Display**: Show Stockfish/Maia engine readiness status consistent with existing patterns
- **Progress Indication**: Use existing progress display patterns for calculation status
- **Overlay System Consistency**: Follow existing disabled state overlay patterns (lines 159-212)

## 4. Algorithm Implementation Details

### 4.1 Player-Aware Tree Pruning Algorithm
```typescript
for (const path of probability_tree) {
  for (const move of path.move_sequence) {
    const position_after_move = makeMove(current_position, move)
    if (move.player === analyzing_player) {
      const move_winrate = stockfish.evaluateAsWinRate(position_after_move, depth=user_depth)
      if (move_winrate < winrate_threshold) {
        // Stop here and capture the damage from our blunder
        path.leaf_position = position_after_move     // After our bad move
        path.leaf_win_rate = move_winrate            // The bad win rate
        path.is_pruned = true
        path.pruning_reason = "analyzing_player_blunder"
        break
      }
    }
    // If opponent makes bad move, continue - we benefit from their mistakes
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Two-Phase Calculation Process
**Phase A: Generate Maia Tree (Show Progress)**
```typescript
// After filtering candidate moves with Stockfish
for (const candidate_move of candidate_moves) {
  const position_after_move = makeMove(current_position, candidate_move)
  const probability_tree = generateMaiaTree(position_after_move, threshold=user_threshold)
  
  // Display tree immediately so user sees progress
  displayTreeInUI(candidate_move, probability_tree)
}
```

**Phase B: Add Stockfish Evaluations to Tree**
```typescript
// Now evaluate all leaf positions with Stockfish
for (const tree of maia_trees) {
  for (const leaf_position of tree.leaf_positions) {
    const leaf_win_rate = stockfish.evaluateAsWinRate(leaf_position, depth=user_depth)
    updateTreeNodeWithWinrate(leaf_position, leaf_win_rate)
  }
  
  // Recalculate expected winrate as Stockfish data comes in
  updateExpectedWinrateDisplay(tree)
}
```

### 4.3 Expected Win Rate Calculation
```typescript
expected_win_rate = Î£(path_probability Ã— leaf_win_rate) // for all valid/pruned paths
normalization_factor = Î£(all_path_probabilities)
normalized_expected_win_rate = expected_win_rate + (1 - normalization_factor) Ã— base_position_win_rate
```
